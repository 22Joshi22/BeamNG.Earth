# Rate limits raised (2026-10-16)

The user asked to raise the per-host limits of docs/research/2026-10-10-rate-limits.md ("we can lower it again
if we run into issues"; every player runs their own server, so these are per player).

| Host | Before | Now |
|---|---|---|
| basemap.nationalmap.gov (USGS photos, CloudFront) | 15/s, burst 60, 6 at once, 60k/day | 50/s, burst 150, 12 at once, 150k/day |
| tiles.mapterhorn.com (elevation, Cloudflare) | 20/s, burst 80, 8 at once, 30k/day | 50/s, burst 200, 16 at once, 80k/day |
| tiles.maps.eox.at (photos outside the US, no CDN, throttles) | 6/s, burst 30, 4 at once, 20k/day | 10/s, burst 40, 6 at once, 30k/day |

Fetch threads to match: imagery.FETCH_WORKERS 6 -> 12, dem.Dem: 8 shared + 8 urgent (Dem.urgent) fetch threads.

Why: a first visit's far field (~500 tiles, ~1500 USGS requests) waited ~100-140 s on 15/s (Crater Lake, Mount
Hood). Watch for 429 / 503 / throttling redirects (netfetch's breakers log them) and lower a host again if it
pushes back.
