"""Temporary files of the atomic writes into the game's user folder, kept outside it.

The game watches its user folder: every file created or changed there is an onFileChanged event, handled in Lua by
every loaded extension, and the engine's FileWatchers took up to ~1 s in a frame during a 100 mph drive (2026-10-17).
A write as "<path>.tmp" then os.replace() made two events per tile file (3,220 in a 3 km drive, 1,079 of them .tmp).
tmp_for(path) puts the temporary file in "beamngEarth_staging" next to the user folder (the same disk: the rename stays
atomic), so only the finished file shows up. Paths outside a user folder's "temp" (the download cache) keep
"<path>.tmp". Pure but for creating that folder.

replace() is the atomic rename into the game's folder; a destination folder that vanished mid-session is made again
(GitHub #27: a player's session folder under temp/beamngEarth was gone, and every terrain write after it failed).
